# Sample Auto Test with Travis CI

This repo is maintained for a sample auto test project with [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/) and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org).

You can automate a small unit test by pushing your working local branch to the remote. Or just simply run `pytest` and one or more test scripts located under `tests/` will be executed.
